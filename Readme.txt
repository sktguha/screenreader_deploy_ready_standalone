----------KEYMAP-----------
(video tutorial http://youtu.be/Qfz-UAqSjRc , this video is actually for the windows one but the keymap is similiar for this)
usage is very simple. select any text and press 
, key .The text selection moves to next line and 'reads it'(i.e upto next full stop)
aloud i.e u will hear the sound from the speakers
similiarly 'm' key goes to previous line and reads it.(i.e upto previous full stop)
' to go upto next punctuation mark
; to go upto previous punctuation mark
 = key to increase speech rate
 - key to decrease speech rate
 ----------HOW IT WORKS------
 the extension works using the chrome tts api. so it is fully independent of platform.
 
windows specific version, (u can use additional 32 bit voices also, requires an exe to be running)
