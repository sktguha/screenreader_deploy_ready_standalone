hello please see the code for screenreader extension. the main file is "screenreader.js".
some functions may be uncommented
or not described well. i am sorry for that. actually i made this for myself to avoid eyestrain
while reading webpages .
so see the video tutorial(http://youtu.be/gmfv3QHrwfM) or a simple description below
----------KEYMAP-----------
usage is very simple. select any text and press 
, key .The text selection moves to next line and 'reads it'(i.e upto next full stop)
aloud i.e u will hear the sound from the speakers
similiarly 'm' key goes to previous line and reads it.(i.e upto previous full stop)
' to go upto next punctuation mark
; to go upto previous punctuation mark
 = key to increase speech rate
 - key to decrease speech rate
 ----------HOW IT WORKS------
 the extension works using the chrome tts api. so it is fully independent of platform.
